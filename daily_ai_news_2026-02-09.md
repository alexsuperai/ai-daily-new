- **Summary**: For instance, according to news by AOL, Zapata and D-Wave have partnered to advance the integration of quantum AI. This collaboration aims to accelerate the development and deployment of integrated quantum and generative AI solutions on D-Wave’s Leap cloud platform.

### Agentic AI

Agentic AI is that powerful AI technology trend that takes artificial intelligence to the next level.  Instead of just following pre-set rules, systems made on agentic AI trends learn from patterns, adjust on the go, and act with minimal human input.

For companies, that could mean customer service that runs itself, supply chains that fix problems before they escalate, and analytics tools that don’t just report data but act on it. [...] ### Quantum AI

Quantum AI is one of the top AI trends, which improves AI algorithms by utilizing quantum computing ideas. This method could pave the way for new developments in areas like complex system optimization, material science, and data encryption by solving complicated problems far more quickly than traditional computers.

This AI trend can greatly enhance machine learning models by handling large datasets more effectively and carrying out computations that are currently impractical. The tremendous processing capacity and accuracy that this technological synergy promises to bring about will have the ability to change industries. As it develops, quantum AI will spur innovation and advances in fields previously restricted by traditional processing power. [...] ### Generative AI

Generative AI, a subfield of machine learning, allows businesses to create algorithms and tools to generate new data, content, and 3D/2D pictures using an existing data set. This branch of artificial intelligence banks on deep learning’s capabilities to understand patterns out of programming languages, audio, video, images, text, or other data types.

#### AI Helps Fight Wildfires [...] Tuberculosis remains one of the deadliest infectious diseases, infecting more than 10 million people worldwide in 2022. Drug-resistant strains make treatment increasingly difficult, but improved TB treatments are on the horizon. Joe Pogliano, professor, and Kit Pogliano, dean and distinguished professor, both in the School of Biological Sciences, worked with Linnaeus Bioscience and Seattle Children’s Research Institute to develop MycoBCP, a new AI-powered tool that could accelerate the search for TB treatments. The technology builds on the Poglianos’ earlier bacterial cytological profiling method, which quickly shows how antibiotics work. By pairing that method with deep learning, researchers could detect subtle changes in TB cells that would otherwise escape the human eye — revealing how [...] The rise of artificial intelligence has already transformed every facet of our lives at a remarkable speed. At UC San Diego, AI is empowering bold advances in science, education, public safety, health and the arts.

### AI AND HEALTH

From uncovering hidden disease mechanisms to guiding new therapies and medical technologies, UC San Diego researchers are harnessing AI to propel humanity toward a future in which diseases are mitigated or eradicated.

### 7. The Future of Artificial Intelligence
- **URL**: [https://www.ibm.com/think/insights/artificial-intelligence-future](https://www.ibm.com/think/insights/artificial-intelligence-future)
- **Published**: 
- **Summary**: ## How AI continues to develop in the next 10 years

Between now and 2034, AI will become a fixture in many aspects of our personal and business lives. Generative AI models such as GPT-4 have shown immense promise in the short time they've been available for public consumption, but their limitations have also become well known. As a result, the future of AI is being defined by a shift toward both open source large-scale models for experimentation and the development of smaller, more efficient models to spur ease of use and facilitate a lower cost. [...] Initiatives such as Llama 3.1, an open source AI model with 400 billion parameters and Mistral Large 2, released for research purposes, illustrate the trend of fostering community collaboration in AI projects while maintaining commercial rights. The growing interest in smaller models has led to the creation of models such as the 11 billion parameter mini GPT 4o-mini, which is fast and cost-effective. It won't be long before there's a model suitable for embedding in devices such as smartphones, especially as the cost continues to decrease. [...] ### Quantum leaps

Quantum AI, using the unique properties of qubits, might shatter the limitations of classical AI by solving problems that were previously unsolvable due to computational constraints. Complex material simulations, vast supply chain optimization and exponentially larger datasets might become feasible in real time. This might transform fields of scientific research, where AI will push the boundaries of discovery in physics, biology and climate science by modeling scenarios that would take classical computers millennia to process.
