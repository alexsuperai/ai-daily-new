### (AI Breakthrough) Chinese Researchers Enhance Evidence-Based Medicine with AI Integration

Date: December 18, 2025

Summary: A team of Chinese researchers has developed a new AI-driven framework designed to streamline and improve the accuracy of evidence-based medicine. By leveraging advanced natural language processing, the system can rapidly synthesize vast amounts of clinical data, helping healthcare professionals identify the most effective treatments with greater precision. This integration aims to reduce the time-consuming nature of manual systematic reviews, potentially accelerating the transition of laboratory findings into clinical practice while minimizing human bias in medical research.

Summary: Arkansas state officials have announced the upcoming installation of new AI-powered camera technology designed to detect drivers using handheld cell phones in highway work zones. Building on existing speed enforcement systems permitted under Act 707, these updated cameras use artificial intelligence to identify specific visual indicators, such as a phone in a driver's hand, while ignoring hands-free Bluetooth usage. The Arkansas Department of Transportation (ARDOT) emphasized that the initiative is focused solely on saving lives following several recent worker fatalities, rather than generating revenue. Enforcement is expected to begin in mid-January, though the move has sparked debates regarding driver privacy and the scope of the original legislation.

### 4. Nine Breakthroughs Made Possible by AI - UC San Diego Today
- **URL**: [https://today.ucsd.edu/story/nine-breakthroughs-made-possible-by-ai](https://today.ucsd.edu/story/nine-breakthroughs-made-possible-by-ai)
- **Published**: 
- **Summary**: #### AI in Motion

UC San Diego engineers have created a flexible patch — a wireless, skin-mounted ultrasound device — that monitors muscle activity in real time to control a robotic arm, among other uses.  To extract additional insights from these muscle signals, the researchers developed an AI algorithm that maps the signals to their corresponding muscle distributions. Compact, battery-powered and designed for long-term wear, the technology could open new possibilities in health care monitoring and human-machine interaction.

#### Using AI to Enable Better Vision [...] “This is the first time machine learning has been applied this way to bacteria,” says Joe Pogliano. The advance, funded in part by the Gates Foundation, could fast-track the development of urgently needed TB therapies.

#### AI Peers Into the Heart

By recording signals from outside of heart muscle cells and using AI to reconstruct what’s happening inside these cells, engineers were able to monitor heart activity with remarkable accuracy — without invasive methods or physically penetrating the cells. The breakthrough offers safer, faster insights into how heart cells function, communicate and respond to new drugs.

#### AI Sharpens Breast Cancer Treatment Plans [...] #### AI Sharpens Breast Cancer Treatment Plans

Researchers have developed advanced deep-learning techniques that could revolutionize treatment planning for breast cancer radiotherapy — making it faster and improving its quality. The approach reduced errors in radiation doses to critical organs, such as the heart and lungs.

- **Published**: 
- **Summary**: ## AI will become central to the research process

 AI is already speeding up breakthroughs in fields like climate modeling, molecular dynamics and materials design, says Peter Lee, president of Microsoft Research. But the next leap is coming. In 2026, AI won’t just summarize papers, answer questions and write reports — it will actively join the process of discovery in physics, chemistry and biology.

“AI will generate hypotheses, use tools and apps that control scientific experiments, and collaborate with both human and AI research colleagues,” Lee says.

#### Tags: [...] Microsoft’s Majorana 1 marks a major development toward more robust quantum systems, Zander says. It’s the first quantum chip built using topological qubits, a design that inherently makes fragile qubits more stable and reliable. It’s also the only quantum solution engineered to catch and correct errors. That architecture paves the way for machines with millions of qubits on a single chip, providing the processing power needed for complex scientific and industrial problems.

“Quantum advantage will drive breakthroughs in materials, medicine and more,” Zander says. “The future of AI and science won’t just be faster, it will be fundamentally redefined.”
